## Setup Instructions
### Building Site Locally
If Jekyll is installed, you can serve the Jekyll site locally by typing the following into your BASH terminal:
```
$ jekyll serve
```
This will build and run the site locally on port 4000 (i.e. `localhost:4000`). Visit said URL to view the site. **Note:** `bundle install/exec` will fail/crash when trying to bundle on Windows because of the nokogiri gem.
