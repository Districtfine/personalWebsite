The source code and documentation for my personal website and blog. Hosts portfolio sections for all my miscellaneous projects as well as my professional work experience.

If Jekyll is installed, you can serve the Jekyll site locally by typing the following into your BASH terminal:
```
$ jekyll serve
```
This will build and run the site locally on port 4000 (i.e. `localhost:4000`). Visit said URL to view the site. Note that `bundle install/exec` will fail/crash when trying to bundle on Windows because of the nokogiri gem.
