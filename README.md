# [Personal Portfolio](http://bassi.li) 

### Introduction & Debriefing
#### What is this project?
This is a repository which holds the code and assets for my personal website (more of a portfolio, really). 
Every front-facing project can seek refuge here; they are given their own dedicated page, thumbnail icon, 
and description paragraphs. Some even have live demos and links to play with. Others don't.
#### Why does this project exist?
I needed a place to hold all of my things. Anything from poetry to automated email checkers has a home here. 
It also helps document my personal developments (without this site, I would just have 'stuff' laying around).

### Installation Instructions
#### How do I play with your portfolio?
Yes. I can't think of a good reason 'why' you'd want to clone and toy with my personal portfolio 
(I could make something up, but it would probably involve the Prime Minister and a ransom). You can clone the 
repository using this: `https://github.com/FlatlanderWoman/portfolio.git` Then, you could pick appart my code and 
call me out on all of my CSS issues (stay away from the lower-lines of `styles.css`, it's a bad neighborhood).

### Miscellaneous
#### Why is this readme so unprofessional?
You gotta let your hair down once and a while, you know. Of all my projects that could use a readme, my portfolio 
might be the best place to have a little fun.
