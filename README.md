# [Portfolio](http://bassi.li) - v3.0 
#### The source code for my personal website & portfolio- which hosts my work as well as some relevant contact information.

## Overview

#### About the Website
This is a clean and succinct place to showcase the things I build, design and publish. Older versions of this site will be cached to preserve their memories (and their code) while also allowing me to upgrade the website over time. See the branches/projects to view the currently developed version.

#### Issue Contribution
If you find any issues, let me know- submit an issue to the repository.
