Source code for my personal portfolio. Below is a brief description of who I am and what I do.

#### Howdy!
##### My name is Michael and I build the internet.
Well, some of it anyway. Using my fingers and a stable caffeine drip, a web-based organism can be born from the heart of Canada. Taught the ways of the internet by Tim Berners-Lee himself, my little organism grows up and becomes successful in an ever-evolving ecosystem of apps and websites. 

To reiterate: I am a freelance Web Developer based out of Vancouver, BC.
