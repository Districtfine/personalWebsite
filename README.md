#### About the Website
This is a clean and succinct place to showcase the things I build, design and publish.

Older versions of this site will be cached to preserve their memories (and their code) while also allowing me to upgrade the website over time.

#### How to Contribute
If you find any issues, let me know. If you want to see the intended plans for the site, visit the [Trello](https://trello.com/b/PFlevudr) page.
