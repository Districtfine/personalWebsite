description:          My name is Michael Bassili, and I am a programmer. I also do other things, many of which are not conventionally productive or helpful to my career. Moreover, I really like those productivity self-help books you can find in the Business section of Chapters—I especially like it when authors of said productivity self-help books talk about themselves like they’re the Productivity Messiah, or something.
