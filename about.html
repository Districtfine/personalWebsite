    Howdy! My name is Michael Bassili, and I am a programmer. I also do other things, many of which are not conventionally productive or helpful to my career. I’m a big fan of those productivity self-help books you can find in the Business section of Chapters (I especially like it when authors of said productivity self-help books talk about themselves like they’re the Productivity Messiahs, or something).
    <br>&emsp;&emsp;I am also a side project activist.
    <br>&emsp;&emsp;I’ve been working towards a Bachelor of Science at Simon Fraser University since 2015, majoring in Computing Science and minoring in Mathematics. While pursuing said degree, I’ve been working as a software QA at Delta Controls Inc.
