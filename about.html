    Howdy! My name is Michael Bassili, and I am a programmer.
    I also do other things, many of which are not conventionally productive or helpful to my career.
    I’m a big fan of those productivity self-help books you can find in the Business section of Chapters (<a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Myth-Revisited-Small-Businesses-About-ebook/dp/B000RO9VJK">I especially like it when authors of said productivity self-help books talk about themselves like they’re the Productivity Messiahs</a>, or something).
    <br>&emsp;&emsp;I am also a side project activist.
    <br>&emsp;&emsp;I’ve been working towards a Bachelor of Science at Simon Fraser University since 2015, majoring in Computing Science and minoring in Mathematics.
    While pursuing said degree, I’ve been working as a software QA at <a href="https://www.deltacontrols.com/">Delta Controls Inc.</a>

    You can find the source code of my technical side projects, <a href="https://github.com/FlatlanderWoman/personalWebsite">including this website</a>, on GitHub.
    I'm <a href="https://github.com/FlatlanderWoman">FlatlanderWoman</a>.
    Significant projects, unlike this website, will be showcased in the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/projects">Projects</a> page of this site.
    In addition to providing links and gallery images of said projects, I enjoy writing little retrospectives. Nothing too fancy, just a little blurb.
