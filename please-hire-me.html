        My name is Michael, and I’m a programmer. 
        I’ve done a lot with Python, particularly with frameworks like Django, Jekyll, and Flask. 
        I also take on a lot of side projects in my free time, like my video game-review website Mike’s Gaming Trove.

        <ul>
            <li>Over five years of Python experience, both personal and professional</li>  
            <li>Dedicated, self-motivated programmer who routinely tries to exceed expectations</li>
            <li>An accomplished creator, having brought dozens of personal and professional projects to fruition</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Over the years, I’ve had the pleasure of taking charge of some seriously entertaining projects.
            Some were programming experiences I hold dear; others are successes in my personal projects.
            Whatever the role, I promise I'll do my best work.
