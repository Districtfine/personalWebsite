    <p id="aboutBody">
        My name is Michael, and I’m a programmer. 
        I’ve done a lot with Python, particularly with frameworks like Django, Jekyll, and Flask. 
        I also take on a lot of side projects in my free time, like my video game-review website Mike’s Gaming Trove.  
        I encourage you to browse the contents of this website via the navigation bar.

        </ul>
        <p>
            Over the years, I’ve had the pleasure of taking charge of some seriously entertaining projects. 
            Some were programming experiences I hold dear; others are successes in my personal projects.

        </ul>

            Whatever the role, I promise I'll do my best work.
