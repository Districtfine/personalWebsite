      Howdy! My name is Michael Bassili, and I am a programmer.
      I also do other things, many of which are not conventionally productive or helpful to my career.
      I’m a big fan of those productivity self-help books you can find in the Business section of Chapters (I especially like it when authors of said productivity self-help books talk about themselves like they’re the Productivity Messiahs, or something).
      I’ve been working towards a Bachelor of Science Computing Science at Simon Fraser University since 2015.
