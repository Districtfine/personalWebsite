    Howdy! My name is Michael Bassili, and I am a programmer.
    I also do other things, many of which are not conventionally productive or helpful to my career.
    I’m a big fan of those productivity self-help books you can find in the Business section of Chapters (I especially like it when authors of said productivity self-help books talk about themselves like they’re the Productivity Messiahs, or something).
    <br><br>I’ve been working towards a Bachelor of Science Computing Science at Simon Fraser University since 2015.
    While pursuing said degree, I’ve been working as a software QA at Delta Controls Inc. remotely.
    Before that, I freelanced for a handful of years as a web designer based out of Vancouver, British Columbia.
    <br><br>Currently, I'm the drummer for the punk rock band Oceans Across.
