    Howdy! My name is Michael Bassili, and I am a programmer.
    I also do other things, many of which are not conventionally productive or helpful to my career.
    I’m a big fan of those productivity self-help books you can find in the Business section of Chapters (I especially like it when authors of said productivity self-help books talk about themselves like they’re the Productivity Messiahs, or something).
    I’ve been working towards a Bachelor of Science Computing Science at Simon Fraser University since 2015.

    While pursuing said degree, I’ve been working as a software QA at Delta Controls Inc. remotely. Before that, I freelanced for a handful of years as a web designer based out of Vancouver, British Columbia. 
    Currently I'm the drummer for the pop punk/emo band Oceans Across. 
    We perform in the local Vancouver area, and we're working on recording music.

    If you want to get in touch, email is best. I also have a LinkedIn profile that I try to keep updated. Besides GitHub and LinkedIn, I don't maintain any sort of social media presence.
