					I like to make things. I started off making mods for The Sims 2, Deus Ex, and The Movies. After a lengthy hiatus (I played a lot of video games), I decided to float around, taking on miscellaneous projects and freelance web dev contracts. I have a bad habit of revisiting long-completed projects with the goal of completely redoing them: this site was redone over ten times (as of fall 2016). I don't know why this happens, but I'm convinced that it's not entirely healthy. Maybe it's the caffeine.

					Below, you will find links to my LinkedIn, and GitHub. The best way to contact me is by email; while I don't check LinkedIn for messages, an email with a subject that contains <span class="code-block">[CONTACT]</span> is the best way to reach me. Any emails which lack the <span class="code-block">[CONTACT]</span> prefix will be filtered to trash.
