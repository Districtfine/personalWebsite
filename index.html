    Howdy! My name is Michael Bassili, and I am a programmer.
    I also do other things, many of which are not conventionally productive or helpful to my career.
    I’m a big fan of those productivity self-help books you can find in the Business section of Chapters (I especially like it when authors of said productivity self-help books talk about themselves like they’re the Productivity Messiahs, or something).
    I’ve been working towards a Bachelor of Science Computing Science at Simon Fraser University since 2015.

      While pursuing said degree, I’ve been working as a software QA at Delta Controls Inc. remotely. Before that, I freelanced for a handful of years as a web designer based out of Vancouver, British Columbia. 
    Currently I'm the drummer for the pop punk/emo band Oceans Across. 
    We perform in the local Vancouver area, and we're working on recording music. 
    You can find links to the band's information and discography in the section below titled "Musical History."
