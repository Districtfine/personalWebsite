    <!-- Summary -->
    <p id="aboutBody">
        Howdy! My name is Michael, and I'm a remote Python developer. 
        I've built software ranging from small benchmarking tools to large-scale automation pipelines. 
        <ul>
            <li>Over five years of Python experience, both personal and professional</li>
            <li>Dedicated, self-motivated programmer who routinely tries to exceed expectations</li>
            <li>An accomplished creator, having brought dozens of personal and professional projects to fruition</li>
        </ul>
        Regardless of the project, tech stack, or development process, I promise to do my best work. 
        If that sounds good, shoot me an email!
