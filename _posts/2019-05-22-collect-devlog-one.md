### The First Of Many Devlogs

It’s been a few months since I’ve started working on Collect: my todo list meant for power-users. I haven’t been working on it for a few months now because of (1) final exams at school, (2) full-time employment at my day job, and (3) recording sessions for my band’s first EP. Suffice it to say that my time has been allocated elsewhere; Collect has laid dormant, until now! Consider this inaugural developer’s log as a sign that this project will be actively worked on until the MVP is working and documented. 

### Initial Development & Planning

The first few months of Collect’s development were spent trying to decide on a colour pallet and logo. I took to the internet to find suitable inspiration, returning with the app’s final colour: blue. Yeah it’s pretty basic, but there are only so many colours I can physically see, what with my colour blindness and all. It was either blue or white/grey like my personal website. A week in and we already had a logo, promotional poster, font, and overall colour scheme downloaded. UI development was under way!

We chose Django for our back-end since (1) it’s written in Python, a familiar language for a Python developer such as myself, (2) its user-friendly installation and workflow, and (3) its portability. I had also used it to develop an Amazon clone for a class project, so I was both mildly familiar with, and biased towards this particular technology.

At this point in time, I took to planning, coding, and testing all the pages I thought I’d need for the MVP. This didn’t take too long, but I was constantly tweaking little visual elements here and there to try to make this thing seem like an actual product, and not like a side-project by some dude. 

### Current Project Objectives

Our current objectives are to (1) get user authentication and management to work, and (2) get trivial task management to work, requiring an authenticated user. These are really the only two milestones that are needed to get this thing to its MVP milestone; anything extra would be considered bonus! Development on the bonus elements really depends on how much potential I see in the MVP, and whether I want to dedicate even more of my time to this project. I have like ten things going on at once, so I need to be cautious with my time and energy.

For now, we’ll leave you with some pictures taken of the UI elements that were completed in this first little sprint of the project. More to come in due time! Wish us luck!
