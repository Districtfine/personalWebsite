**TL;DR** *please design your software with the colour blind and visibly impaired in mind. A good tip is to design in grayscale and work upwards from there. That way, a partially-blind person with monochromacy can reasonably navigate your software.*

## I: Cities: Skylines Colour Issues

My grandest and most esoteric hobby is transit management in the game Cities: Skylines. I spend about five hours building and populating a large urban city center. Then, when traffic becomes a problem, I begin the process of introducing free and efficient public transit systems throughout. I find it cathartic watching my simulated civilians get to work using nothing but a bike, two legs, and a transit pass. Where my hobby encounters issues, however, is in the colour department.

You have to zone land in Cities: Skylines in order for buildings to be constructed. You have a selection of various zones ranging from low-density residential, to offices, to high-density commercial, and everything in between. Each zone is assigned its very own colour. And, that right there is the problem.

I am red-green colour blind, so I struggle to make out the subtle differences in the residential zones. As this is my hobby, I found myself frustrated on the daily. I'd turn my back to find my carefully planned highrise district laden with suburban homes. A terrible shock! This got me thinking about visual accessibility in video games (and software in general). As a software developer myself, I thought it fun to share my insight and tips for making your software easy-to-use for the visually impaired.
