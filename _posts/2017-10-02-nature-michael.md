July, August, and September were dedicated to being outdoors. I work from the confines of an office for the most part, so I needed to stretch my legs. I bought a bike and decided to set some stretch goals:
-	Become one with nature (or something); take up outdoor yoga
-	Ditch the carpool for a day; bike to-and-from work
-	Renounce coffee; quit hard caffeine forever 

The first stretch goal was the easiest to achieve, so it happened first. I bought a spare yoga mat and set up shop in the derelict backyard—my other mat lives in my office desk for the twice-weekly company yoga session. I told myself that every morning, at around five thirty, I would jump out of bed, run outside, and give my neighbors a show. I have a kindergartener’s knowledge of yoga, so I paid close attention during my sessions at work, cobbling up my own session at home using the spare parts I remembered from class. By August’s end, mornings became colder than ideal; for the rest of the quarter, I alternated between afternoon yoga outdoors and morning yoga inside. Overall, moderate success.

The second goal was to bike to work—at least once. This is another satisfactory success. I spent July quietly biking longer distances across town, trying to build up stamina. I went from Coquitlam to Port Coquitlam. Then, Coquitlam to Maple Ridge. Finally, I kept going until I hit Surrey through Maple Ridge. I then found a co-worker willing to escort me from Coquitlam to my Cloverdale office one morning.

I used Strava to track some of my trips. The two maps shown here are from my final commute. The trip to work was roughly twenty-five kilometers and can be found [here]( https://www.strava.com/activities/1201122744). The trip home was a little different; sore, I opted for the longer, flatter route. This “scenic” route spans roughly thirty kilometers and can be found [here]( https://www.strava.com/activities/1201889484).

The third and final stretch goal will get its own project post. I tracked my subjective mood and energy levels for three weeks while I quit hard caffeine cold turkey. Decaf coffee in hand, I (painfully) slogged through twenty-one days of caffeine withdrawal, graphing my progress and harvesting data. For closure, I did successfully quit caffeine, concluding all of Nature Michael’s stretch goals.
