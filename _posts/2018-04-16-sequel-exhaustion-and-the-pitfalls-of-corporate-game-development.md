### Part I: Timelessness and Corporate Game Design

> Games shouldn't only be fun. They should teach or spark an interest in other things.

It was about the same time as I was watching the Far Cry 5 teaser that I realized that I had already played Far Cry 5. Not really, though. I had explored a map, littered with things to do, people to gloss past, and pretty mountains to zoom through. I had fired the same weapons before, and I had driven similar vehicles before. But, that doesn't sound right? Far Cry 5 has been praised for being [the best darn Far Cry game to date](http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/far-cry-5). It has undergone "[very positive refinements](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/far-cry-5-review-rocky-mountain-high/1900-6416885/)." [Reviews are glowing](http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/far-cry-5). But, watching the gameplay trailers and reading the reviews impressed a sense of familiarity. I'd definitely done this before.

This was Far Cry, not Far Cry 5; this game was the newest Far Cry game in the same way Madden NFL 18 was the newest Madden NFL game.

And, there's nothing wrong with that. Annual-ish franchise sequels come out all the time, and whatever market there is for annual-ish franchise sequels go out and buy this stuff. My issue here is that I am looking forward to playing less games every year, because some company or another keeps absorbing the franchises/companies/developers I like, suffocating them in their capitalist fold, ripe for milking. We saw this with [Maxis](https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/05/business/electronic-arts-will-buy-maxis-in-swap.html), and we saw the release of SimCity, [a pile of hot garbage](http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/simcity) boasting less content than its ten year old sibling--it was also one of those stupid Always Online games we'll never get to play in ten years' time since their servers will eventually be re purposed for the next pile of hot garbage. More recently, we saw [Konami cancelling Silent Hills](https://www.polygon.com/2015/4/27/8503201/silent-hills-canceled-konami-confirms), [canning Kojima](https://www.polygon.com/2015/12/16/10220356/hideo-kojima-konami-explainer-metal-gear-solid-silent-hills), and releasing Metal Gear Survive, [another pile of hot garbage](http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/metal-gear-survive). At this rate, new, creative and quality IPs are being created slower than the ones I like are being canceled. In other words, I'm n

From now on, I'll be referring to piles of hot garbage as "Corporate Games." Games that were not made by a developer, but rather engineered by corporate dudes gunning for maximum profit. [Star Wars Battlefront 2 (2017)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP7KFvBXHHs) was a Corporate Game, and Deus Ex was not.

Corporate Games have many glaring faults, but their most egregious one is their lack of replayability, longevity, or timelessness. There is not enough content in SimCity to last you past the five hour mark, and you'll probably never see someone boot it up ten years down the line. On the flip side, Sim City 4 is still playable--still feature-rich and complex--today, and often goes on sale to ~5 bucks. [The online features SimCity boasted on release](https://kotaku.com/5915377/like-diablo-iii-sim-city-will-require-an-online-connection) will be [dead in a decade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darkspore#March_2016_server_closure), so good luck trying to use your purchased product in the future. Games that require persistent online access (unless they're multiplayer-focused games) are Corporate Games. They weren't built for you; they were built for shareholders. In other words: Corporate Games are not timeless.

Back to my initial point, the reason I could've sworn I'd played Far Cry 5 is because Corporate Games converge to homogeneity. They leech the best mechanics from other games to create this messy blob they call an open world, AAA action RPG. Your Watch Dogs, your Far Crys, your Call of Dutys; every one of those games iterates off games from different genres. Watch Dogs had a tacked-on skill tree reminiscent of RPGs, but with none of the weight or complexity those RPGs carry. Far Cry too. Call of Duty & Halo swiped the movement controls from Titanfall, muddying the lines between those AAA shooters. I'm not advocating against genre mixing, but I just think it's lazy to incorporate alien elements into your game without incorporating them into the core of your title. An RPG skill tree is a waste of resources if all it offers is a linear damage upgrade.

### Part II: Pro-Consumer, Legacy Games

> I think there's always room for more innovation and new things.

Legacy Games are the opposite of Corporate Games: they promote longevity, bolster replayability, and offer deep, enriching mechanics. [They may come with bots](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=9073-WOHK-7760), so that a player won't need to rely on servers later down the line. [Their content is not cut out and sold back to you on launch](https://kotaku.com/5887626/mass-effect-3-dlc-triggers-fan-outrage-bioware-response). These are the games that last. Here are some examples of Legacy Games:

* Metal Gear Solid 3: a perfect example of a Legacy Game, MGS3 has NG+ modes, unlockable outfits, a high skill ceiling and a low skill floor. You'd have no problem inserting your MGS3/Legacy Collection/HD Collection disk and playing away.

* Dead Rising 2: what I'd consider to be the best of the Dead Rising games, a dense world, populated with too many bosses, survivors, and side stuff to complete in your first run. You can pick this up on steam for under ten dollars on-sale, and it trumps Dead Rising 4 in almost all respects.

* Counter Strike Source/GO: bots, a server browser, and mods prolong the shelf life of Counter Strike. They are a bargain in terms of sheer value, since you can boot this thing up any time in the foreseeable future and still be able to play with little to no issues.

Legacy Games are the games you should look for in stores. Buying a Legacy Game provides better bang for your buck, while supporting those developers who make Legacy Games. A lot of people forget that buying a crappy game doesn't help; you speak with your wallets! Corporate Games wouldn't have gotten so prominent in mainstream AAA if people weren't buying them. While yearly installments of Assassin's Creed and Call of Duty are selling like hot cakes, those polished and content-rich games over on the indie side aren't. Games like [Cities: Skylines absolutely wipe the floor with SimCity](https://kotaku.com/a-malaysian-city-recreated-in-cities-skylines-1823861545), but they're gambles. Trying to usurp a AAA's throne is tough, but if the success of Cities: Skylines taught us anything, its that money talks. SimCity is dead--there's no more DLC being made, and EA is unlikely to put out a sequel anytime soon. But, it's not because city builders are a dead genre. [Cities: Skylines was super duper successful](https://www.pcgamesn.com/paradox-profits-cities-skylines-sales), and that's because good games are attractive. Cities has mod support, a healthy assortment of diverse DLC, robust mechanics, and [it's sold for a pittance on any given Steam Sale](https://www.pcgamer.com/cities-skylines-is-75-percent-off-for-a-limited-time/).

 In order for more developers to take risks in game development, it's important that we (1) stop buying Corporate Games, and (2) make more conscious choices as a consumer. The more games like Madden NFL 18 sell, the less likely AAA publishers are to make something truly consumer-friendly--when Corporate Games thrive, consumers suffer, and Legacy Games go extinct.

### Part III: Speaking With Your Wallets

> I'm a hardcore gamer and would never let you down by designing a crappy title.

I just rambled on about something I feel strongly about, so I'll make this last section brief: don't support Corporate Games and their publishers. EA and Ubisoft are easy targets, but it's nontrivial to find more out there. Publishers like Activision make a killing off recycled games and lazy ideas. The medium stagnates, and consumers suffer when this happens. Companies pay attention to their bottom line, so next time you're out on the town and you notice EA's next Star Wars game, stop. Just stop, and ask yourself if you're willing to fund a broken games economy which facilitates the production of Corporate Game garbage. Ask yourself if you really need to play this year's Madden. Do some light soul searching and see if your $40-90 can be spent elsewhere on something better.

As a consumer, you have a choice between pro-consumer products and corporate cash grabs, so spend (or don't spend) wisely, because your impulse buy could lead to the next SimCity/Battlefront 2/etc. And, who really wants that?
