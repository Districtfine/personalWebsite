**TL:DR;** Mike's Gaming Trove was a games journalism website founded about a year ago. In its peak, it saw upwards of 10k readers a month. After some careful deliberating, I've decided that the site should close. 

## I: Introduction To Mike's Gaming Trove

Last August, I founded [Mike's Gaming Trove](https://laputanmachines.github.io/MikesGamingTrove/). It was a video game journalism platform specializing on deep analyses of complex games. The first article was a review of Deus Ex (2000) and its final article was a filler piece on what the Nintendo Switch needs in 2020. You can see the disconnect.

In it's peak, Mike's Gaming Trove saw upwards of 10k readers a month. That number is too large to appreciate for me. Looking back, I'm quite proud (and a little shocked that people found my writing entertaining). The "crown jewel" of the site was its Fighting Game Mega Mix. It was a 200k word novella reviewing thirty fighting games. It saw almost 50k readers in its lifetime, a number that made me numb in the knees. It took upwards of a month to write and research; I still can't play Street Fighter without getting research-related shivers. 

## II: Why The Site Had To Close Down

My goal was to create a space where quality trumped quantity. Where insightful and detailed articles were the norm. A space where people could congregate and discuss video games. Initially, I succeeded. The site saw high readership and the content was good enough to motivate me. 

When the COVID-19 pandemic forced the closure of my university, I found myself staying home a lot. Despite my ample time at home, I noticed I hadn't felt the need to contribute more to the site. I wanted to keep content flowing though the site, but I also wanted to do other things. 

At the time, I had a Patreon with one Patron. That was enough to incentivize me to write _something_ on the site. So I wrote a filler article about the Nintendo Switch. It was lazy, embarrassing, and a black stain on the integrity of the site. In my mind, this was like sending my baby up to the guillotine. I had personally transitioned from a quality-oriented content creator to one that was satisfied with uploading garbage. Something had changed in my approach to the website, and that meant that something had to change. 

Today, April 22nd 2020, I decided to close down the website. It's primary domain (mikesgamingtrove.ca) was decoupled from the site. The website itself will remain up ([https://laputanmachines.github.io/MikesGamingTrove](https://laputanmachines.github.io/MikesGamingTrove)) but it will no longer be maintained. Much of the content of the site can now be found here, on my personal website. You will not find the Switch article here.

## III: What Went Right

Initially, everything was going according to plan. I was proud of the content I was producing, and I was gaining readers by the week. I kept a brisk one-week writing window for new articles leading to fresh content being delivered every Monday. 

I used Notion to plan articles and track readership. I also brainstormed ideas on a digital whiteboard using Krita and a Wacom tablet. When I got busy, I'd use my laptop to write in coffee shops to keep me engaged; it's very hard to keep writing one single thing from one single location. A big productivity technique I learned was to change up your working location every once and a while.

My favourite article was the Fighting Game Mega Mix. It was as long as a novella. It took two full months of work to get it out the door. It was also my last "good" piece of content on the site. I don't want to blame the piece too much, but I think the website and my stamina never recovered after the publication of that piece. The reason I came up with for this was that I was enamoured with the quality and scope of the piece. I wanted all subsequent pieces to be as grand and rich. I couldn't maintain that, so it demotivated me.

One all-around plus was that I produced more writing than I ever had. Getting into the habit of writing was tough, but it's a skill I will take with me forever.

It also landed me a freelance writing gig. I used Mike's Gaming Trove to pitch to EGM ([egmnow.com](https://egmnow.com)). I had interviewed game developers and games preservationists from around the world. My first freelance journalism piece was all done. That same week, EGM announced [it would no longer publish features](https://egmnow.com/turning-the-page/). This personally hit me hard. I had slaved for weeks over a feature that would never be published. As of April 22nd 2020, Uppercut Magazine ([https://uppercutcrit.com/](https://uppercutcrit.com/)) has pledged to publish the abandoned EGM pieces. I still haven't heard back from them.

## IV: What Went Wrong

My expectations of the site became unreasonable, and that demotivated me completely. I wanted every piece to be as amazing as the Fighting Game Mega Mix. I know I should've tempered expectations, but I _felt_ like I could do anything. I could take on any project and publish anything I wanted. It was liberating and self-destructive. This project will stand as a monolith to expectations. Future projects will have a harder time growing uncontrollably knowing that MGT died from a lack of motivation.

"Technically," the piece that killed the site was the Switch piece I published in March. I felt terrible publishing it. I feel terrible looking at it now. I won't delete it. Like a tattoo, this piece will remain stamped onto my baby. It will upset me whenever I look at it, and it will remind me that sustainable development and realistic expectations for quality & quantity trump any ambition. Any dream. Future projects will be smaller in scope and manageable by a single person. 

## V: Final Thoughts

It might be difficult for some to understand why I did this. "Why not just keep working on the site anyways?" "Why not delete the shitty article and keep going as if nothing happened?" The core issue isn't the website, or my workflow, or my content, or my management of the whole thing. It's me. I came into the project with a goal, and I can no longer keep that goal going. The whole point of this project can no longer be realized. There was a fundamental paradigm shift within its creator. When your sole project designer loses their grip, when they forget what they're building and why they're building it, it's impossible to come back. In times like these, companies fire their PM and hire a new body to steer the ship back on course. I'm just one person, and I've got bigger and better things I'd rather be doing with my time. 

I'm grateful to the some-200k readers Mike's Gaming Trove cumulatively hosted. I'm grateful for those in my life that supported this project. I'm happy I took the risk and made something I could be proud of. And I'm grateful that I'm mature enough, as both a developer and as a person, to kill a pet project when it veers off course. 

As of Wednesday, April 22nd, 2020, Mike's Gaming Trove is officially dead.
