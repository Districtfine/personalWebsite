First, let me say: Howdy! Howdy to all those who found this page, and howdy to those who were forced to read this by yours truly. I’ve always wanted to document my thoughts (I document everything else I do), but I was never sold on the read-my-blog-because-I’m-super-important kind of lifestyle. Documentation is great (it really is), but nobody cares about my relative stress levels over a given month. No one that I know, anyway. But, here I am, writing a primer meant to bookend this weird documentation expedition we’re about to undertake. I’m excited, so let’s get started.

The goal of this primer is to introduce the idea of Quarterly Themes. Every quarter of the year (so, every three months), I create and follow some theme. A theme that, given enough time and effort, will completely envelop me for the duration of the quarter. Along with said theme is a list of milestones to accomplish before quarter’s end. So, in the beginning of every quarter, I’ll sit down with myself and brainstorm some milestones, themes, and plans of attack. While tedious (and time consuming), the overall goal of doing this is to experience new things. And not just “experience” them. But really experience them. I will do everything in my power to ensure that I adhere to whatever theme past-me had set out for current-me. A good example is Q3-2017; the theme was nature. So, Nature Michel did everything outside. He ate his meals on the patio (weather be damned), he biked to work (legs/lungs permitting), and he went on tons of long walks at night. 

An ideal quarter would have me, Michael, inheriting all the best traits from that quarter’s Michael (e.g. Michael would inherit the best traits from Chef Michael). The result is a me that is more well rounded and interesting to write a blog about (ha, that was a joke). I can draft up a laundry-list of inherited traits from past-Michaels, so the system must be working (or at least not completely failing). There used to be long-form quarterly reviews—where I’d go through the quarter and assess past-Michael’s progress and accomplishments, but I’ve been told (by too many people) that doing that is profoundly unhealthy. So, here we are, dear reader. Instead of quarterly reviews, I’ll just lightly document the quarter (by lightly, I mean turgidly) so that future-Michael can have something to show his grandkids.
