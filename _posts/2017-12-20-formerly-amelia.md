### Book Summary and Brief Discussion

In 2017, I wrote a novella. It was broken into two parts, revolving around a different cast of characters as they attempt to navigate the world around them. The following article is not meant to sell the book, but rather discuss some themes and conclusions within the book.

The first part follows Henry and Ian, former book publishers turned rigmasters. The two are prompted to abandon their lives on the mainland, cope with loss, and become new people. The narrative is simple: the pair move out to the South Side sea, become rigmasters, and fall victim to greed—a commonplace in this world. Henry attempts to con other rigmasters, while Ian loses his marbles. The duo ultimately perishes. The second follows a couple: Mel and Anderson. They are captured by rebels against their new-world government and are forced to live as refugees atop their ship.

Both stories focus not on the characters shown, but their world, told through their (and the narrator’s) eyes. Henry & Ian’s story defines the rules of this world. The government is mostly automated, with some notable exceptions. The mainland is obscured until the second part, where Mel & Anderson’s tale show the reader how “leisurely” their society is. Laziness is just business as usual there; people are retired their entire lives, with the only jobs available are menial and lack-luster. Important jobs are handled by robots.

All the book’s protagonists die in the end, by the way. I’m not usually a fan of happy endings, and I thought this book doesn’t deserve one. You can argue that Mel and Anderson’s death was a victory because of how lazy and uncomfortable their lives were before they became refugees, but my intention was to withhold a happy ending (or indeed any sort of resolution) from the reader.
