#### What is "Formerly, Amelia"?

Formerly, Amelia is a novella centered around the goings-on of the fictitious country of Conomarco—a country where, for the most part, human labor has been replaced by automation. The book itself is broken into two main parts; the first act follows Henry Hilberts & Ian Fitzroy as they lose their jobs and move out to an oil rig; the second act follows Anderson and Mel Andy as they vacation in the rebel-infested East Side province.

#### An Unartistic Motivation

I maintain a long list of potential side-projects (or personal-projects, depending on how often I work on them). Every month, I randomly select a project idea and see if it’s realizable. The idea here is that every year, I get 12-ish projects completed. The reality here is that I complete six-ish projects a year. Thanks to Formerly, Amelia, I concluded 2017 with 4 side projects under my belt.

Six months ago—roughly in July, “Book” was selected as that month’s project. This, unfortunately, overflowed into subsequent months, wrapping up in the middle of December. 

#### Development Process

Months one to three were spent writing the first draft. I’d return from work at around 18:00 and would step into a local coffee shop to write. I’d sit there until closing hours, at 21:00. This routine got boring a month in, obviously, so I started to randomly select the local coffee shop I worked in. Unfortunately, this resulted in me being bored in eleven different coffee shops. The problem was that the process of writing and re-writing gets boring after a while, regardless of what/where/why you’re writing. But, before long, I was on month four.

Months four and five were dedicated to proofreading the garbage I had written. And, I mean garbage. Just trash. I pretty much re-wrote the entire book from the ground up because I hated the thing I had produced. This time, I switched my writing schedule around so that I could avoid a new problem: fatigue. A new workout regiment meant that I was pooped after work, so I needed to work earlier. Work begins at 09:00, so I would wake up at 04:30 and walk over to the local Starbucks—the only coffee shop nearby which opens at 04:30. Four hours of work would get done before eight hours of work would get done; I was not happy with my schedule. 

The final month was spent putting the thing together. I hired a proof-reader and an artist. I went through and formatted the digital and physical book myself. This was the most uneventful (and relaxing) month of them all. I mainly emailed people and played videogames. 

#### Why Should I Give You Money?

You shouldn't. Click [here]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/formerly-amelia-book.pdf) to download a PDF copy of the book for yourself. If you like it, consider buying a copy for your neighbor, or something. Despite what many people have suggested, I don't intend to make money off this. The goal of doing these projects is to create stuff, not to generate capital. I have a job for that.

If you decide to throw money at me, you'll find the physical and digital copy on [Amazon](http://a.co/2Q2xs64) and [Google Play](https://goo.gl/gBypL7) (digital only).
