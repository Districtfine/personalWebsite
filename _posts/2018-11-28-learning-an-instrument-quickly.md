### My Progress So Far
I set out to learn an instrument this year. The two that drew me in were bass guitar or drums, because they seemed straightforward and simple to self-teach. Having played the drums in middle school for a bit, I bought an electric kit. I followed along with any free drum tutorials I could find online, and I bought a couple of books on advanced techniques (specifically, Syncopation for the Modern Drummer, and Limb Independence). Pressure is a great way to learn something in a short amount of time; I had only been playing for about four months before applying for bands in my area. I recorded and mastered a cover of Basket Case by Green Day, and sent it out to all local bands looking for someone to keep time. The one I joined in the end was lead by an old high school friend. About three months later, we played our first gig at Static Jupiter, a new venue in downtown Vancouver.

### Overall Process of Learning
Some thoughts on learning an instrument quickly: find time in your day to schedule a minimum of 15 minutes of deliberate practice. You need that kind of momentum and persistence in order to play catch up with those who’ve been playing casually for a few years. And, when you do practice, have an end goal in mind. “I want to learn this new song.” “I want my left-handed singles to become fluid and consistent.” “I want both feet to have similar coordination.” Without an end goal in mind, you’ll sometimes find it difficult to justify spending an hour playing an instrument you can barely hold. When you struggle, you need to be able to tell yourself that “you’re doing this in order to do X.” Setting aside some time to plan out milestones, therefore, becomes immensely important.

Joining a band early on forced me to improve at a rate I hadn’t expected before. Someone was counting on me; we had implicit deadlines, and a local reputation to maintain. We, as a group, needed to sound good. And, in order for the group to sound good, every individual within the band had to be on point. I was playing a little catch-up, since my bandmate had already written many songs he intended for the band to play. I’d receive some songs via email, listen to them a few times, chart them, and practice all that week until we sounded good. This cycle persisted for about two months, and I learned countless new techniques and tips for playing fast & playing loose. My bandmate lined up a gig, and so for one month, my drumming practice was heightened.

### Concluding Thoughts
There was a real fear that I wouldn’t be good enough to perform; that I would break something on stage; that I wouldn’t be able to communicate my music clearly to others. But, we practiced, and we performed, and it was a lot of fun. We sounded great, and I had absolutely none of my fears realize. My review of learning an instrument quickly: pretty good. I knew I wouldn’t become a master or anything in less than a year, but I’m happy that I was able to get to a place where I could write something and people would like listening to it. I’m going to continue playing the drums (obviously), so I wonder if my thoughts on the process of learning an instrument quickly will change over. It probably will.
