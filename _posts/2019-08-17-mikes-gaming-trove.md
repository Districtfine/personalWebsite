### Mike's Gaming Trove Releases Today

Today marks the beginning of my two-week vacation before I return to school. It also marks the launch of the first (of many) side projects I’ve been working on. (You can find the Trello board I’m using to track my projects under the “Projects” page of the site). 
    
[Mike’s Gaming Trove](https://mikesgamingtrove.ca) is going to be my outlet for talking about video games I find particularly interesting or useful. Instead of simply reviewing games, I chose instead to discuss the game’s mechanics, kinesthetics, and narrative through relevant literary lenses. This means that instead of talking about how [Deus Ex (2000)](https://mikesgamingtrove.ca/2019/08/17/deus-ex-2000.html) has really good RPG mechanics and level design that works to enhance them, I decided to talk about how that game used narrative tricks to recontextualize play. Deus Ex doesn’t just pull the old-switcheroo on its players, but it forced them to reframe their past (and future) play in the wake of new and troublesome information. I hope that talking about games like this will set my platform apart from other, established platforms.

So, if any of that sounded interesting to you, then I urge you to check out Mike’s Gaming Trove. The first feature on [Deus Ex (2000)](https://mikesgamingtrove.ca/2019/08/17/deus-ex-2000.html) has just been published, so you’ll be able to get a feel for the style of content I’m aiming to produce. If that doesn’t sound appealing to you, stay tuned, because I’m going to be putting out a few more projects that will be sure to grab someone’s attention.
