### Sweet, Black Beverage

About two years ago, I set out to quit coffee. I mainly resented my dependence on an unnecessary substance, and I had a lot of free time on my hands. Over the course of 21 days, I tracked my mood and energy levels every hour, on the hour, after quitting coffee cold-turkey. I got used to drinking 4 large coffees a day; about 95mg per large coffee by four coffees makes 380mg of caffeine in my system a day. Here were the rules:

- Only decaf coffee is allowed, no drip coffee or espresso beverages
- Sodas are “okay” but I never drink sodas, so this never actually came out
 
Obviously, my mood and energy levels are subjective, but I think the data generated from my personal survey was interesting enough to graph and document. [Click here to download the spreadsheet, along with all the graphs](/assets/quittingCoffee/coffeeLog.xlsx). The data in this post has been pulled from this spreadsheet.

So, here's the data pulled from my spreadsheet. I've only included the weekly averages, as 21 data tables sounds like a bit much. The original spreadsheet includes all 21 days of data and figures.

### Week 1: Absolutely Terrible

The first week was a disaster. My mood and energy levels were so low that I was actually falling asleep at my desk. Without coffee, I would wake up with a headache. After lunch time, I would just sit at my desk and listen to white noise on my computer to kill time.

| Date | Energy | Mood |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 25-08-2017 | 56.25% | 59.38% |
| 26-08-2017 | 38.33% | 30.00% |
| 27-08-2017 | 32.14% | 32.14% |
| 28-08-2017 | 50.00% | 29.69% |
| 29-08-2017 | 35.00% | 26.67% |
| 30-08-2017 | 48.21% | 53.57% |
| 31-08-2017 | 79.41% | 79.41% |

So overall, terrible week. I had no idea that my body was this reliant on coffee to move me through my day-to-day. At this stage, I hoped that the next week would be of little improvement. Literally anything would've been better than what I felt in that first week.

### Week 2: Getting Better

Wow! I'm doing great (at least according to the numbers)! My mood and energy levels have improved drastically, and my headaches have disappeared. It looks to me like a few days to a week was needed for my body to begin to adjust to life without caffeine.

| Date | Energy | Mood |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 01-09-2017 | 66.18% | 64.71% |
| 02-09-2017 | 81.94% | 80.56% |
| 03-09-2017 | 80.36% | 80.36% |
| 04-09-2017 | 87.50% | 87.50% |
| 05-09-2017 | 69.44% | 76.39% |
| 06-09-2017 | 79.41% | 79.41% |
| 07-09-2017 | 90.28% | 93.06% |

Good news all around! It was around this week that I started becoming productive again at work. I wasn’t half-asleep every noon, and I was more involved with my work. I started to miss the taste of a good cup of coffee, though; the decaf stuff we have at the office just doesn’t taste the same.

### Week 3: Exceeding Energy Expectations

Energy and mood are looking amazing. I have no data from before this experiment, but I suspect I’d poll somewhere along what we have here. Mood and energy are consistently good, and I’m getting used to drinking decaf.

| Date | Energy | Mood |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 08-09-2017 | 70.83% | 84.72% |
| 09-09-2017 | 86.54% | 95.83% |
| 10-09-2017 | 95.00% | 85.00% |
| 11-09-2017 | 82.69% | 86.54% |
| 12-09-2017 | 70.83% | 81.94% |
| 13-09-2017 | 79.17% | 87.50% |
| 14-09-2017 | 78.57% | 91.07% |

The third day of the third week was amazing, boasting high-90% energy levels, which pretty much meant that I was jumping all around throughout the day. For comparison, the third day of my first week saw a 30% energy level. I was basically asleep in that first week.

### Final Thoughts

So, seeing the data, I conclude that the first week was the toughest. Afterwards, my energy and mood had basically risen to the levels I would expect on a daily basis. I’m back on the soup again, but I can only really have a single medium cup a day. Overall, I found this to be a worthwhile experience.
