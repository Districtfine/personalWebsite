### Sweet, Black Beverage

About two years ago, I set out to quit coffee. I mainly resented my dependence on an unnecessary substance, and I had a lot of free time on my hands. Over the course of 21 days, I tracked my mood and energy levels every hour, on the hour, after quitting coffee cold-turkey. I got used to drinking 4 large coffees a day; about 95mg per large coffee by four coffees makes 380mg of caffeine in my system a day. Here were the rules:

- Only decaf coffee is allowed, no drip coffee or espresso beverages
- Sodas are “okay” but I never drink sodas, so this never actually came out
 
Obviously, my mood and energy levels are subjective, but I think the data generated from my personal survey was interesting enough to graph and document. [Click here to download the spreadsheet, along with all the graphs](/assets/quittingCoffee/coffeeLog.xlsx). The data in this post has been pulled from this spreadsheet.
