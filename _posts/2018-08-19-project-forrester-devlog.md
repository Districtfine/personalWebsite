### 19/08/2018 --- Project Description

Project Forrester is an unnamed city planning game which is still in the early stages of pre-production.
The principle gameplay involves the high-level management of a sprawling metropolis.
Unlike games such as SimCity or Cities: Skylines, players will not be managing the city directly; they will be managing the city through the use of city officials and employees.
Players will hire employees to draft city policy, zone new land, and invest in various income-generating endeavors.

I intend to develop this game using the Godot game engine, as it is Open Source and satisfies all my personal expectations.
Additional staff/freelancers/contributors will probably be brought on as the project grows.
