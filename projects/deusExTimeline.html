			<p class="project-description">
				 In an attempt to make the <a href="http://deusex.wikia.com/wiki/Deus_Ex_Wiki">Deus Ex Wiki</a>'s Timeline more readable, Deus Ex: Timeline was created. A site which hosts the information found on the Deus Ex Wikia encapsulated in an improved interface. Designed mobile-first, Deus Ex: Timeline features data categorization which grants users the ability to shuffle through sub-categories of data- ranging from centuries to games. No fluff, no ads, just raw content. <br> <br>
